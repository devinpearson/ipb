## Installation

Before installing, [download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

To install or upgrade the CLI, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install -g investec-ipb
```

## Configuration

You can access your client id, client secret and api key from the Investec Developer Portal.
More information on how to access your keys can be found on the [Investec Developer Community Wiki](https://investec.gitbook.io/programmable-banking-community-wiki/get-started/api-quick-start-guide/how-to-get-your-api-keys).

To configure the CLI, run the following command:

```bash
ipb config --client-id <client-id> --client-secret <client-secret> --card-id <card-id>
```

If you want to set up specific environments for your code, you can set the environment variables in a `.env` file in the root of your project.

```shell
INVESTEC_HOST=https://openapi.investec.com
INVESTEC_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
INVESTEC_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
INVESTEC_API_KEY=your-api-key
INVESTEC_CARD_KEY=your-card-key
```

You also have the option to specify the host, client id, client secret, api key and card id when calling each command. These will override the configuration set in the `.env` file and your credential file.

```bash
ipb deploy -f <filename> -e <environment> -c <card-id> --host <host> --client-id <client-id> --client-secret <client-secret> --api-key <api-key>
```

You can also create your own `.credentials.json` file and store and access it in a location you prefer. This file should be in the following format:

```json
{
  "client_id": "your-client-id",
  "client_secret": "your-client-secret",
  "api_key": "your-api-key",
  "card_id": "your-card-id"
}
```

To configure the CLI using a credentials file, run the following command:

```bash
ipb cards --credentials-file <path-to-credentials-file>
```

The card id is optional and can be set when calling each command. If you specify a card when calling a command, it will override the card id set in the configuration.

## Usage

There are six main commands that you can use to interact with the card:

- `cards`
- `deploy`
- `run`
- `logs`
- `enable`
- `disable`
- `countries`
- `currencies`
- `merchants`

There are also additional functions that you can use to interact with the card if you prefer handling the process yourself.

- `fetch`
- `upload`
- `env`
- `upload-env`
- `published`
- `publish`
- `simulate` (online simulator)

### Card list

To get a list of your cards with card keys, card number and whether the card is enabled for card code,

run the following command for card list:

```bash
ipb cards
```

![cards command](assets/cards.gif)

### Code Deployment

for environment variables, you can set them in a `.env` file in the root of your project.
You should name your environments such as `.env.prod` or `.env.dev` and then specify the environment when running the command.
To call on these environments you will specify prod or dev as the environment.
This makes sure you dont upload the .env file for your current code project.

To deploy code to your card, run the following command:

```bash
ipb deploy -f <filename> -e <environment> -c <card-id>
```

![deploy command](assets/deploy.gif)

### Fetching Execution Logs

To fetch your execution logs and saving them to a file. This output is json format, example naming such as `executions.json` or `logs.json`,
This function will overwrite the file if it already exists.
run the following command to save the logs to the filename specified:

```bash
ipb logs -f <filename> -c <card-id>
```

![logs command](assets/logs.gif)

### Run - Local Simulation

You can run local simulation of your code and specify the transactions details as arguments.
The amount is is in cents and the currency is the ISO 4217 currency code.

The local emulator will run the code against the local files and not the card. It does not require an Investec account or any API keys. It runs locally without hitting the Investec API.

To run a transaction against your local files, run the following command:

```bash
ipb run -f main.js -e prod --amount 60000 --currency ZAR --mcc 0000 --merchant "Test Merchant" --city "Test City" --country ZA
```

![run command](assets/run.gif)

### New Project

To scaffold a new project, run the following command:

template is optional and can be set to `default` or `petro` to create a project using one of the templates

```bash
ipb new <project-name> --template <template-name>
```

![new command](assets/new.gif)

### Enable and Disable Code

To enable or disable code on your card, run the following commands:

```bash
ipb enable -c <card-id>
```

```bash
ipb disable -c <card-id>
```

![toggle command](assets/toggle.gif)

### Countries

Retrieve a list of countries that can be used in the card code.

```bash
ipb countries
```

### Currencies

Retrieve a list of currencies that can be used in the card code.

```bash
ipb currencies
```

### Merchants

Retrieve a list of merchants that can be used in the card code.

```bash
ipb merchants
```

### Fetch Code

To fetch the code saved on the card, run the following command:

```bash
ipb fetch -f <filename> -c <card-id>
```

### Upload Code

To upload code to the cards saved code, run the following command:

```bash
ipb upload -f <filename> -c <card-id>
```

### Fetch Environment Variables

To fetch the environment variables saved on the card, run the following command:

```bash
ipb env -f <filename> -c <card-id>
```

### Upload Environment Variables

To upload environment variables to the card, run the following command:

```bash
ipb upload-env -f <filename> -c <card-id>
```

### Fetch Published Code

To fetch the published code saved on the card, run the following command:

```bash
ipb published -f <filename> -c <card-id>
```

### Publish Code

To publish code to the card you will need the codeId returned when saving the code using the upload command, run the following command:

```bash
ipb publish -f <filename> --code-id <code-id> -c <card-id>
```

### Simulate Code

You can use the online simulator to test your code without deploying it to the card. This is very similar to the run command but it uses the online simulator instead of the local emulator. be aware that it will use your online env and not your local env.

```bash
ipb simulate -f main.js -c <card-key> --amount 60000 --currency ZAR --mcc 0000 --merchant "Test Merchant" --city "Test City" --country ZA
```
